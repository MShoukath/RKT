*Introduction*
We will look at the basic ggplot2 use using the faithful dataset, giving 
information on the eruption pattern of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone
National Park.

Datasets:
```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    data("faithful")
    data("mpg")
    
    Movies = read.csv("P2-Movie-Ratings.csv")
    colnames(Movies) = c("Film", "Genre","CriticR","AudienceR","BudgetM","Year")
    Movies$Genre = factor(Movies$Genre)
    Movies$Year = factor(Movies$Year)
    
```
  *Data,Aesthetics and mapping*
```{r}
ggplot(data = faithful, 
       mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
  geom_point()


# Data and mapping can be given both as global (in ggplot()) or per layer
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting),
             data = faithful)
```

If an aesthetic is linked to data it is put into `aes()`

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, colour = eruptions < 3))
```

If you simple want to set it to a value, put it outside of `aes()`

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting),
             colour = 'steelblue')
```

Some geoms only need a single mapping and will calculate the rest for you

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eruptions))
```

geoms are drawn in the order they are added. The point layer is thus drawn on
top of the density contours in the example below.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
  geom_density_2d() + 
  geom_point()
```

*Exercise*

Modify the code below to make the points larger squares and slightly transparent.
See `?geom_point` for more information on the point layer.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting))
```

Hint 1: transparency is controlled with `alpha`, and shape with `shape`
Hint 2: remember the difference between mapping and setting aesthetics

* * *

Colour the two distributions in the histogram with different colours

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eruptions))
```

Hint 1: For polygons you can map two different colour-like aesthetics: `colour` 
(the colour of the stroke) and `fill` (the fill colour)

* * *

Colour the distributions in the histogram by whether `waiting` is above or below 
`60`. What happens?

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eruptions, fill = waiting < 60), position = "dodge", alpha = 0.5)
```

Change the plot above by setting `position = 'dodge'` in `geom_histogram()` 
(while keeping the colouring by `waiting`). What do `position` control? 


 *Statistics*
We will use the `mpg` dataset giving information about fuel economy on different 
car models.

Every geom has a stat. This is why new data (`count`) can appear when using 
`geom_bar()`.

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Genre))
```

The stat can be overwritten. If we have precomputed count we don't want any 
additional computations to perform and we use the `identity` stat to leave the 
data alone

```{r}
library(dplyr)
Movies_counted <- Movies %>% 
  count(Genre, name = 'count')
ggplot(Movies_counted) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Genre, y = count, fill = Genre), stat = 'identity')
```

Most obvious geom+stat combinations have a dedicated geom constructor. The one
above is available directly as `geom_col()`

```{r}
ggplot(Movies_counted) + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Genre, y = count, fill = Genre))
```

Values calculated by the stat is available with the `after_stat()` function 
inside `aes()`. You can do all sorts of computations inside that.

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Genre, y = after_stat(100 * count / sum(count))))
```

Many stats provide multiple variations of the same calculation, and provides a
default (here, `density`)

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = AudienceR))
```

While the others must be used with the `after_stat()` function

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = AudienceR, y = after_stat(scaled)))
```

  *Exercises*
While most people use `geom_*()` when adding layers, it is just as valid to add 
a `stat_*()` with an attached geom. Look at `geom_bar()` and figure out which
stat it uses as default. Then modify the code to use the stat directly instead
(i.e. adding `stat_*()` instead of `geom_bar()`)

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = class))
  ?geom_bar()
```

  *Scales*
Scales define how the mapping you specify inside `aes()` should happen. All 
mappings have an associated scale even if not specified.

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = CriticR, y = AudienceR, colour = Genre)) + geom_smooth(aes(x = CriticR, y = AudienceR, colour = Genre), fill = NA)
```

take control by adding one explicitly. All scales follow the same naming 
conventions.

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = CriticR, y = AudienceR, colour = Genre)) + 
  scale_colour_brewer(type = 'qual')
```

Positional mappings (x and y) also have associated scales.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(3, 5, 6)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10')
```

 *Exercises*

Modify the code below to create a bubble chart (scatterplot with size mapped to
a continuous variable) showing `cyl` with size. Make sure that only the present 
amount of cylinders (4, 5, 6, and 8) are present in the legend.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) + 
  scale_colour_brewer(type = 'qual')
```

Hint: The `breaks` argument in the scale is used to control which values are
present in the legend.

Explore the different types of size scales available in ggplot2. Is the default
the most appropriate here?

* * *

Modify the code below so that colour is no longer mapped to the discrete `class`
variable, but to the continuous `cty` variable. What happens to the guide?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class, size = cty))
```

 *Facets*
The facet defines how data is split among panels. The default facet 
(`facet_null()`) puts all the data in a single panel, while `facet_wrap()` and
`facet_grid()` allows you to specify different types of small multiples

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = CriticR, y = AudienceR, color = Genre)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ Genre)
```

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = CriticR, y = AudienceR, color = Genre)) + 
  facet_grid(Year ~ Genre)
```

 *Exercises*
One of the great things about facets is that they share the axes between the 
different panels. Sometimes this is undiserable though, and the behaviour can
be changed with the `scales` argument. Experiment with the different possible
settings in the plot below:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ drv)
```

* * *

Usually the space occupied by each panel is equal. This can create problems when
different scales are used. Modify the code below so that the y scale differs 
between the panels in the plot. What happens?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = manufacturer)) + 
  facet_grid(class ~ .)
```

Use the `space` argument in `facet_grid()` to change the plot above so each bar 
has the same width again.

* * *

Facets can be based on multiple variables by adding them together. Try to 
recreate the same panels present in the plot below by using `facet_wrap()`

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(year ~ drv)
```

  *Coordinates*
The coordinate system is the fabric you draw your layers on in the end. The 
default `coord_cartesion provides the standard rectangular x-y coordinate 
system. Changing the coordinate system can have dramatic effects
```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Genre, fill = Genre)) + 
  coord_polar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Movies) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Genre, fill = Genre)) + 
  coord_polar(theta = 'y') + 
  expand_limits(y = 180)
```

You can zoom both on the scale...

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = class)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40))
```

and in the coord. You usually want the latter as it avoids changing the plotted
data

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = class)) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 40))
```

  *Exercises*
In the same way as limits can be set in both the positional scale and the coord,
so can transformations, using `coord_trans()`. Modify the code below to apply a
log transformation to the y axis; first using `scale_y_continuous()`, 
and then using `coord_trans()`. Compare the results â€” how do they differ?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = hwy, y = displ))
```

  *Theme*
Theming defines the feel and look of your final visualisation and is something
you will normally defer to the final polishing of the plot. It is very easy to 
change looks with a prebuild theme

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = class)) + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

Further adjustments can be done in the end to get exactly the look you want

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = class)) + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  labs(title = "Number of car models per class",
       caption = "source: http://fueleconomy.gov",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, NA)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    text = element_text('Avenir Next Condensed'),
    strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold', hjust = 0),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = 'italic'),
    panel.grid.major = element_line('white', size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.ontop = TRUE
  )
```
